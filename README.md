--WORK IN PROGRESS-- This is a simple web application that simulates a cake in real life. The application will ask the user to enter their name, age, and regard to wish their loved ones, colleagues, or acquaintances a happy birthday. Once they enter the information, the website will render a birthday cake decorated with lit candles based on their age. The birthday person can make a wish and blow out the candles until no candles are lit, similar to how one receives a surprise birthday cake in real life. To make the blowing candles function possible, I implemented a microphone record and volume analyzer functions in javascript, converting microphone data into volume loudness based on a scale from 0 to 100. This way, I can adjust the loudness to trigger the blowing event according to the device type.

This application is open-source, nonprofitable, and a personal project. The project was inspired by Tru Narla, aka mewtru. Narla is a software engineer who regularly streams fun coding projects on Twitch. She is also on several social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Here are links to her accounts:
